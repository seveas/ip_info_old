ip_info
=======

Really simple django app that provides you info about where you're connecting
from. Similar to sites like whatismyip.com, but without all the clutter and
crap.

Dependencies:
 * Django (pip install django / http://djangoproject.com)
 * whelk (pip install whelk / https://seveas.github.com/whelk)
 * publicsuffix (pip install publicsuffix / http://pypi.python.org/pypi/publicsuffix/ )
 * geoip and a maxmind datafile are needed to display city/country info (optional)
   to use this, set GEOIP_DATA in your settings.py to the path of the datafile
